# three-dimensional-cellular-automata

This is the repository for my study project to implement three-dimensional cellular automata with this video as inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs

It depends on my engine https://github.com/icy0/accelerator which was at the time called "renderhub" and isn't compatible to it's up-to-date version anymore, which is why I included the compatible version in the repo.

Building requires a CUDA NVCC installation and DirectX 11 compatibility.
