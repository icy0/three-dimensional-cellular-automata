# three-dimensional-cellular-automata
This is the repository for my study project to implement three-dimensional cellular automata with this video as inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs

It depends on my engine https://github.com/icy0/accelerator which was at the time called "renderhub".
